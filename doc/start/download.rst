Get Disco
=========

Release and Development branches
--------------------------------

The Disco source code is available at `github`_.  To get the latest
development branch::

        git clone git://github.com/discoproject/disco.git

For released versions, check out the appropriate release tag from the
repository.

If compiling from source, you cannot use the zip or tar.gz packages
generated by github, but must instead get the git repo using the above
command.

Debian packages
---------------

You can generate Debian packages for Disco using the
`make-discoproject-debian` script at the top of the source tree.  This
script builds the following packages: `disco-master`, `disco-node` and
`python-disco`.

Install the `disco-master` package on your master node.  If you run
Disco in a cluster, you should install the `disco-node` package on the
other nodes in the cluster.  The `python-disco` package should be
installed on all client machines from which Disco jobs are submitted.

After installation, see steps 4-6 in :ref:`Setting up Disco
<configauth>` that describe how to configure and test Disco.

.. warning:: **Our Debian packages are experimental!**
        They may not play nicely with other packages or they may destroy your computer.
